PrototAU - Development Plan

The page will be a flat-one-page design using embedded LinkedIn as the "blog component".
All in all, the components will be in the following order:

1. Navbar (done but needs tweaking)
2. Slider Carousel /w correct image resources & catching text (button needs design tweak)
3. Brief about section (what, who, where)
4. Statement from Allesandro (president's statement + overall mission statement?)
5. Meet the team, similar to "https://www.kickstarter.com/team" but squared pictures in a grid (use bootstraps grid)
6. Sponsor Banner (make sure the "primary" sponsor gets top view and then descend down
7. LinkedIn embedd (blog like)
8. Footer /w contact information

** Everything needs to be responsive so make use of bootstrap **

For 5.: My proposal is to create a addtional html file for the team and just include this into the index.html file. Functionality would be the same as I created in the index.html file.

For 2.: Changed the buttons.
